# Manual, visual, exploratorive feedback

I would like to see the results from the first test scenario in action. But a 'start' script is not available in package.json. Can you incorporate a working feedback arena, for manual, exploratorive feedback?

## chats response

Built a lightweight “feedback arena” you can run locally.

What changed

Added start scripts with tsx: run the server directly from TS (package.json).
Included Node types in TS config for the server (tsconfig.json).
New HTTP server serving a tiny API and static UI (src/server.ts), using the same in-memory board service.
Minimal UI to create cards and view them (public/index.html, public/main.js, public/styles.css).
How to use

Start: npm run dev (or npm start). Visit http://localhost:5173/.
Use the form to create a card (defaults to user “alice” and column Todo). Cards list updates and persists in memory for the process lifetime.
Tests

npm test still passes (ATDD scenario).
Next steps

Add move/delete flows to the UI and API; 2) swap in real persistence (file or Git-backed) so the arena survives restarts; 3) later: auth/SSE wiring once ready.

# Instead of inline UI editing support, can you introduce a view/edit behavior on the cards instead?

When title/text should be changed the user of the system would prefer to click an edit icon, and change back to view again, for not unintentionally changing these fields.

TDD driven UnitTests for the view/edit behavior would be good.

## chats response
Added explicit view/edit toggling for card details with supporting tests.

What’s new

Introduced a tiny edit state helper (src/client/editState.ts) with unit tests (tests/unit/editState.spec.ts).
Cards now render in view mode by default with an “Edit” button; clicking toggles edit mode. In edit mode you can change title/text, then “Save” or “Cancel” back to view.
Save updates both title and text via existing API endpoints; cancel reverts to view without changes. Edit state is tracked per card.
UI includes the “Text” field in the create form and shows card text in swimlanes; cards now use safe DOM rendering (no innerHTML).
Tweaked static serving order to prefer public/ when STATIC_DIR isn’t set, so the updated UI is served without stale dist.
Tests: npm test (15 passing).

How to use

Run npm start (or rebuild your Docker image) and reload. Each card shows an “Edit” toggle; use it to switch to edit mode, modify title/text, then Save or Cancel.

Consider persisting notifications for reconnects or missed events.

# chats response
Added replayable SSE support and covered it with tests so reconnects/missed events get current board state.

What changed

SSE hub now tracks event history with IDs, replays missed events using Last-Event-ID, and can send an initial snapshot on subscribe; events are stored with a small buffer and heartbeats continue (src/sseHub.ts).
Server’s /events endpoint now seeds new subscribers with the current board and honors Last-Event-ID to replay missed updates (src/server.ts).
Delete/create/move already broadcast full board snapshots via the notifier, so reconnecting clients can catch up.
UI still listens on /events; it will now also receive the initial snapshot and any replayed updates automatically.
Added unit coverage for SSE broadcasting and replay behavior (tests/unit/sseHub.spec.ts).
Tests

npm test (8 passing).
How to use

Run npm start, open multiple browser windows; create/move/delete cards in one, and if another window reconnects after a drop, it receives the latest board via replayed SSE events.

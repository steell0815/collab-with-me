Add subscription management and broadcast on card creation/move/delete.

# chats response
Added real broadcast coverage for create/move/delete and better SSE subscription handling.

Key changes

Board layer: notifier now publishes full board snapshots on any change (create/move/delete), with a new delete operation and updated BoardNotifier API (src/board.ts).
Server: SSE hub is used as notifier; /events now seeds new subscribers with the current board and broadcasts on all mutations. Added DELETE /api/cards endpoint for removal (src/server.ts).
UI: cards now include a delete button; EventSource connection stays and re-renders on broadcasts (public/main.js).
SSE hub: can send an initial message when subscribing (src/sseHub.ts), plus a unit test to cover broadcasts (tests/unit/sseHub.spec.ts).
DSL/tests: notifications are tracked per user, new delete action, and an ATDD scenario validating delete notifications (tests/atdd/dsl.ts, tests/atdd/notifications.spec.ts).
Tests

npm test (7 passing).
Try it

npm start, open two browser windows; create/move/delete cards in one and watch the other update instantly via SSE.

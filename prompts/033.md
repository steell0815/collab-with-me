# Write down a recipy markdown file to describe the necessary steps for a hosting the application using docker compose on a dedicated machine.

1. Consider the need for a real version, like running 'npm run compute:version' upfront.
2. Consider the settings for configuring OIDC flow with an external oidc server.

## chats response
Added a hosting recipe at docs/hosting-recipe.md detailing how to prepare a real version (npm run compute:version), configure external OIDC settings, and run the app via docker compose up --build using the mounted version file and your OIDC env vars.

# During a manual test experienced an issue, that cards seem to be identified by title.

As a result, as soon as there are more cards with the exact same title, a move operation will affect only a single card, and a delete operation will delete all cards matching the same title.

```
scenario("Cards are unique by internal uuid.", () => {
  cardOneIdentifier = when.userCreatesCard({ title: "Write tests", column: "Todo 1" });
  then.changeIsPersisted();
  cardTwoIdentifier = when.userCreatesCard({ title: "Write tests", column: "Todo 2" });
  then.changeIsPersisted();
  then.assertNotEqual(cardOneIdentifier, cardTwoIdentifier);
});
```

## chats response
Implemented ID-based card operations to avoid title collisions and ensured creator display remains human-friendly:

Server endpoints now accept card IDs for move/update/delete/title/text/expand operations; BoardService uses IDs throughout.
UI updated to send IDs, render data attributes with IDs, and keep card creation showing user names while header stays unchanged.
Acceptance DSL now resolves IDs by title and returns IDs from creation to match new behavior.
All tests pass after the change.
Files touched: src/board.ts, src/server.ts, public/main.js, tests/atdd/dsl.ts.

# console error - cardsCache is not defined
The application shows an error to the user and in the console:

```
main.js:414 ReferenceError: cardsCache is not defined
    at fetchCards (main.js:59:14)
```

Please fix.

## chats response
Added missing cardsCache declaration in public/main.js to resolve the ReferenceError shown in the console.

Harden security: input validation and escaping seems necessary, as json like input breaks the cards and their buttons to apply actions are gone.

# chats response
Hardened input handling and rendering to prevent malformed/HTML content from breaking the UI:

Backend: added sanitizeTitle (trim, strip newlines, length guard) used on create/move/delete; server validates titles and returns 400 with message on bad input (src/board.ts, src/server.ts).
Frontend: card rendering now builds DOM nodes with textContent and data attributes instead of innerHTML, ensuring titles/users can’t inject markup (public/main.js).
Tests: npm test (9 passing).

Rebuild/restart and try entering JSON/HTML-like titles—the UI should remain intact and reject invalid titles.

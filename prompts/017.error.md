# The build distribution javascript/assets are not loaded correctly
The index.html refers to:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" />
```
and
```
<script src="/main.js" type="module"></script>
```

These resources cannot be resolved, probably they need to be prepended wit '.'

## chats response
Adjusted asset paths so built HTML resolves correctly when served from dist:

Updated public/index.html to use relative links (./styles.css, ./main.js).
Tests: npm test (9 passing).

Rebuild (npm run build:ci) and serve dist/; assets should now load without 404s.

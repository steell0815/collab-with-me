# The cards should be vertically aligned from top to bottom per swimlane
- Their size, when collapsed, should be constant and not vertically grow just because the sourrounding swimlanes grow.
- Their expanded size should be as long as necessary to display the content.

# Chats response
Aligned lane/card layout so cards keep their intrinsic height (collapsed stays compact, expanded grows to content) while all swimlanes start at the top. Changes are in styles.css.

Next steps if you want to verify:

Refresh the page and compare lanes with uneven card counts.
Toggle card expansion to confirm only the expanded card grows.

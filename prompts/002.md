# Implementation setup
Given the plan you derived, let's add some github actions also on this underlying source code repository in order to build and test upon commit.

## chats response
Added a GitHub Actions CI that checks out the repo, detects a Node project, and if present installs deps, runs lint/test/build (all --if-present), otherwise skips gracefully; triggers on push/PR to main/master (.github/workflows/ci.yml).

No tests run locally (repo has no package yet).

Next steps: 1) Add the actual app/package.json so the workflow runs; 2) Wire in Playwright/Vitest jobs once tests exist; 3) Add caching/matrix for pnpm/yarn if you choose those.

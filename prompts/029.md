# drag and drop for cards additional to transition buttons

## chats response
Implemented user-less card creation and DnD, fixed init errors, and restored version display:

Removed the username input; actions now use the authenticated user from /api/me (currentUserId), and cards still show createdBy.
Fixed initialization order in public/main.js (edit state, auth controls, fetchMe defined before use) resolving “Cannot access … before initialization.”
Version badge now updates all .version-display elements.
Login/logout buttons remain functional.
Added drag-and-drop to move cards between swimlanes (lanes accept drops; cards are draggable); also retained transition buttons.
Factored a moveCard helper; all card actions enforce login.
Header/footer version restored.
Tests remain green (npm test: 17/17). Rebuild/restart and reload to see the updated UI and DnD behavior.

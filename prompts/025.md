# instead of button text use icons and allow layout to be more stable to sizing issues

Edit -> pencil symbol
Save -> cloud symbol
Todo -> open checkbox symbol
In Progress -> Cog wheels symbol
Done -> marked checkbox symbol
Waste -> Bin symbol
Cancel -> Cross symbol

## chats response
Replaced button text with compact icons for more stable layout:

Move buttons now use symbols: Todo ☐, In Progress ⚙️, Done ☑️, Waste 🗑.
Edit toggle uses pencil (✏️) and switches to ✖ when in edit mode; Save uses cloud (☁️); Cancel uses ✖; Delete uses bin (🗑).
Added .icon-btn styling for consistent sizing (public/styles.css).
All tests still pass (npm test: 15/15). Refresh/rebuild to see the icon-based controls.

## implementation flaws
1. done is also represented by a waste bin symbol, when it should be a marked checkbox.
2. buttons still grow vertically, they should have fixed size.

### chats response
Fixed the icon/layout issues:

Move buttons now map correctly: Todo ☐, In Progress ⚙️, Done ☑️, Waste 🗑 (no more bin icon for Done).
Icon buttons have fixed dimensions (width: 44px; height: 38px;) to prevent vertical growth and keep layout stable.
Tests: npm test (15/15 passing).

Refresh/rebuild to see the corrected icons and fixed-size buttons.

## flaw: waste and delete cannot be differentiated really.

Probably it's better to have delete as red x icon

### chats response
Clarified the icons and sizing:

Delete now uses a red “✖” with a .danger style to differentiate from Waste’s bin icon (public/main.js, public/styles.css).
Icon buttons have fixed dimensions to prevent vertical growth (public/styles.css).
Tests remain green (npm test 15/15). Refresh/rebuild to see the updated icons and consistent button sizing.

## flaws: text box does not treat line breaks.

### chats response
Applied proper line-break handling for card text:

Added white-space: pre-wrap; to .card-text so newlines entered in the textarea render as intended (public/styles.css).
Tests: npm test (15/15 passing). Refresh/rebuild to see multiline text preserved in cards.

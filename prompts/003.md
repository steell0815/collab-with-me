# First ATDD

Let's implement a first scenario

```
scenario("Create a card into Todo", () => {
  given.userIsAuthenticated("alice");
  when.userCreatesCard({ title: "Write tests", column: "Todo" });
  then.boardShowsCard("Write tests", "Todo");
  then.changeIsPersisted();
});
```

## chats response
Added a minimal Node/TypeScript/Vitest scaffold and recorded the first ATDD scenario as a pending test. Files: package.json (scripts + dev deps), tsconfig.json, DSL stubs tests/atdd/dsl.ts, and scenario tests/atdd/create-card.spec.ts (marked skipped via scenario = test.skip).

I didn’t run installs/tests since dependencies aren’t installed yet. Next steps: 1) run npm install to fetch deps; 2) un-skip the scenario and implement the protocol driver + app behavior so it passes; 3) expand the DSL for additional scenarios.

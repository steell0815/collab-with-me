# pipeline error

Set up Node.js
Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/collab-with-me/collab-with-me. Supported file patterns: package-lock.json,npm-shrinkwrap.json,yarn.lock

## chats response
Added a lockfile and allowed it to be tracked so CI can find dependencies: generated package-lock.json and removed the ignore rule for it in .gitignore. Re-run the GitHub Action; the “lock file not found” error should be resolved. No tests run for this change.

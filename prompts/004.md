# npm install

I manually performed 'npm install'. Please unskip scenario and go on.

## chats response

Unskipped and implemented the first ATDD scenario end-to-end. Added a minimal domain layer (src/board.ts) with a board service, column type, card model, and in-memory repository. Wired the DSL to real behavior (tests/atdd/dsl.ts) so given/when/then drive the service and assert persistence. The scenario file remains the same but now runs and passes (npm test).

Next steps: 1) Extend the DSL for move/list/delete flows; 2) Add a persistence abstraction (file/Git) to replace the in-memory repo; 3) Introduce OIDC/auth handling and SSE plumbing as the next ATDDs demand.

No build step defined yet

## chats response
Added a real build step so build:ci produces a distributable.

New build script copies public into dist (scripts/build.js); package.json build now runs it.
Version injection now writes dist/version.json, creating dist if needed (scripts/inject-version.js).
build:ci remains npm run build && node ./scripts/inject-version.js.
Tests still pass: npm test (9 passing).
CI should no longer report “No build step defined yet,” and artifacts will include the dist contents.

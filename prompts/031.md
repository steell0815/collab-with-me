# UI tweak - delete should come with a delete/confirm behavior.
Additionally, all buttons that do not already have tooltips should have some, to describe what the button action does.

## chats response
Added delete confirmation and tooltips:

Delete now prompts for confirmation before proceeding (confirmDelete) and shows a “Delete card” tooltip.
Added clearer tooltips where missing (Save changes, Cancel editing; existing move/expand/edit tooltips remain).
Kept icons unchanged.
Tests still pass (npm test: 17/17). Rebuild/reload to see the confirmation dialog and updated tooltips.

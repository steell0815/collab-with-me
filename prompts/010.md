Wire a real SSE hub to the BoardNotifier and expose /events so the feedback arena can live-update.

# chats response
Hooked up real SSE notifications and live updates for the feedback arena.

What changed

Added an SSE hub (src/sseHub.ts) to manage clients, broadcasts, and heartbeats.
Wired the server to use the hub as the BoardNotifier; every card change now broadcasts the current cards to all subscribers, exposed via GET /events with keep-alives (src/server.ts).
UI now opens an EventSource on /events and refreshes the board on incoming events (public/main.js).
Added a small unit test to verify SSE hub broadcast behavior (tests/unit/sseHub.spec.ts).
Tests

npm test (6 passing).
How to try

Run npm start, open the app in two browser windows, move/create cards in one; the other should live-update via SSE.
